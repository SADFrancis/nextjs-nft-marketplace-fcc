# About

This is a contract for an NFT marketplace deployed on Goerli. Instructed by Free Code Camp's Hardhat Solidity course, this project's architecture is inspired by Artion, an NFT marketplace on the Fantom Chain. Artion's strategy in listing NFTs is to approve NFTs to be listed without the NFTs being sent to the contract, similar to Ebay's style. The listing is derived from querying the first several events using the Graph indexing in addition to using Pinata.cloud for hosting NFT image data.

The Goerli contract address is: 0xd88806d8007d666b967e0dDd1eDaC612A77f6D32
